#Creating a Drawing App in kivy

#What is kivy??
Kivy is a platform-independent GUI tool in Python. As it can be run on Android, IOS, Linux and Windows, etc. It is basically used to develop the Android application, but it does not mean that it cannot be used on Desktop applications.
#Drawing App:
In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple drawing App with the help of kivy initially we are just making a canvas and a paintbrush so that by moving the cursor you can just feel like a drawing Application.
The widgets are added dynamically. We are using widgets, layout, random to make it good.

#Pre requirement:(In Windows)
Pip install kivy
